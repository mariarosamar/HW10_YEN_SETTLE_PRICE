Unit 10 Yen Future Prices - Time Series Return and Volatility


Observations:

In the plotting of settle price of yen I appreciate an upward trend, a seasonality, and volatility in the settle price. Moving average, and exponential moving average let see better these observations. (Graph: Plotting Settle Price Yen-Dollar)
An exponential moving average responded faster than a moving average of 15 to changes on the settle price of yen-dollar.
Hodrick-Plotter let observes an upward trend on the settle price, and the noise hide seasonality. (Graphs: HPrescott Trend and HPrescot Noise)

Model of Lineal Regression of return of settle price and lagged return shows a R2 low that means the model cannot helps to predict settle returns. Both lineal regression using different autoregressive count=1 and moving average = 2, and autoregressive Count = 17 and moving average = 6 show a R2 low.

Plotting the residual from the ARIMA model shows that residuals are taking seasonality of the model. (Graph: Residuals Arima Model)
The model in the near term, 15 days or 3 week shows a falling of the settle price. (Graph: Forecast 15 days Arima) 

In relation to the volatility the GARCH model shows low anualized volatility in 2019 in relations to years before. (Graph: Volatility Garch Model)
The forecasting volatility for the next 3 days shows low volatility but growing on these 3 days, that can affect the return on almost 7%. (Chart: Forecast Next 3 days of Volatility.., Graph: Forecast Next 3 days of Volatil. Graph)
